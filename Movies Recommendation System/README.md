## Movie Recommender System Project

Welcome to the Movie Recommender System Project! In this exciting data-driven venture, we aim to build a powerful content-based recommender system to help users discover their next favorite movies.

### Project Overview

Our project utilizes the [TMDB Movie Metadata Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata?select=tmdb_5000_movies.csv) from Kaggle. This rich dataset contains information about thousands of movies, including their genres, cast, crew, and user ratings.

### Goals

1. Data Exploration: We'll delve into the dataset to gain insights into the movies and their attributes, understanding their distributions and relationships.

2. Content-Based Filtering: Employing advanced techniques, we'll build a content-based recommender system. By analyzing movie attributes, we'll recommend similar movies to users based on their preferences.



### Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn for data processing and modeling
