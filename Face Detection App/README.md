This Streamlit web application showcases the capabilities of OpenCV and Streamlit to perform various image enhancement and face detection tasks. The app allows users to upload an image and apply different enhancements to it, as well as detect faces, eyes, smiles, and even create artistic effects like cartoonization and edge detection.

## How to Use

1. Upload an Image: On the left sidebar, click the "Upload Image" button to select an image (supported formats: jpg, png, jpeg).

2. Image Enhancements: Choose from various enhancement options such as converting to gray-scale, adjusting contrast, brightness, and blurring. You can also view the original image without any enhancements.

3. Feature Detection: Select the feature you want to detect from the dropdown list. The available options are:
   - Faces: Detects and highlights faces in the uploaded image.
   - Smiles: Detects and highlights smiles on faces.
   - Eyes: Detects and highlights eyes on faces.
   - Cannize: Applies edge detection, creating an artistic "canny" effect.
   - Cartonize: Transforms the image into a cartoon-like version.

4. Process: Click the "Process" button to apply the selected enhancement or perform feature detection.
